https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241812	"Isaak Iosifovich Dunayevsky was born on January 30, 1900 in Lokhvitsa, Poltava, Russian Empire. His grandfather was a cantor. His father, named Iosif Dunayevsky was a cashier at the Loans Society, he also was an amateur artist. His mother, named Rosalia Dunayevsky, played piano and sang for their seven children, of whom six brothers became musicians. In 1910 Dunayevsky enrolled in the Kharkov School of Music of the Imperial Russian Music Society. There he studied piano, violin with Iosif Yu. Akhron, and composition with Simon. S. Bogatyrev. He graduated from the Kharkov Conservatory in 1919, and was a violinist and composer at the Kharkov Drama Theatre.In 1923 Dunayevsky moved to Moscow and became the music director at the Theatre of Satire. He then moved to Leninsrad (now St. Petersburg), where he was appointed the Music Director of the Leningrad Music Hall and for the Big Band of Leonid Utyosov. He composed 12 operettas and was one of the founders of modern musical in the Soviet Union. Among his early admirers were Mikhail A. Bulgakov and Vsevolod Meyerhold. At that time, in Leningrad, Dunayevsky started his work in film. He was also the director of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Leningrad House of Pioneers, and also was elected the Chairman of the Leningrad Union of ComposersDunayevsky is best known for his film music. His most popular film scores are 'Veselye Rebyata' (1934), 'Vratar' (1935), 'Tsirk' (1936), 'Deti Kapitana Granta' (1936), 'Volga-Volga' (1938), 'Svetly Put' (1940), 'Vesna' (1947), 'Kubanskie Kazaki' (1950), and other. Dunayevsky developed his own distinctive style, combining Russian folk songs with the American Jazz and the tradition of neo-Viennese operetta, the genre best represented by Emmerich Kálmán and Franz Lehár. He also absorbed the influences from the music of industrial age, the beat of Jazz, musical Impressionism of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and harmonic innovations of Sympho-Jazz. He always composed songs in a Major key.Dunayevsky was a unique personality in the history of culture. In the times of the "Great Terror" under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin Dunayevsky managed to bring innovations by introducing the taste of Jazz and foreign entertainment into the rigid Soviet culture. His songs gained outstanding popularity in the former Soviet Union and internationally. His collaboration with the legendary singer and band-leader Leonid Utyosov was quintessential for the career of both men. Utyosov introduced Dunayevsky to director Grigoriy Aleksandrov and they made the first Soviet blockbusters 'Veselye Rebyata' (aka 'The Merry Guys', or 'Jolly Fellows' 1934) and 'Tsirk' (Circus 1936).During the dangerous time of the Nazi occupation of the Soviet Union in WWII, Dunayevsky with his music troupe was entertaining the Red Army troops. At that time he was the artistic director of the Ensemble of the Central Railway House of Culture. He was on road for about 2 years, concertizing in the rear of the Russian armies. During the war he composed mostly patriotic songs and lyrical romances. At the end of WWII Dunayevsky moved to Moscow. He continued his collaboration with Grigoriy Aleksandrov and Lyubov Orlova in their new films 'Vesna' (The Spring 1947) and 'Kubanskie Kazaki' (The Kuban Cossacs 1950). He was awarded the State Stalin's Prize twice, in 1936 and 1950.Dunayevsky later suffered from the official censorship campaign against intellectuals, as well as Sergei Prokofiev, Anna Akhmatova, Aram Khachaturyan and other cultural figures in the Soviet Union. He fell into disgrace at the time of political struggle before and after the death of Joseph Stalin. Dunayevsky was viciously attacked by a high ranking Soviet official from the Ministry of Culture, who made libelous statements against the composer, and accused him of "cosmopolitism" and all kind of sins. Dunayevsky was working on his operetta 'White Acacia' (1955) to be premiered at the Moscow Operetta Theatre in November of 1955. That was to be his 'swan song', the last and unfinished work.He died on July 25, 1955 of a heart attack. His radiant, cheerful and optimistic songs remain very popular today."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323936	Beautiful and distinguished, exceptionally gifted (she could play the piano, dance, practice skiing and underwater fishing, and of course... act!), Danielle Godet had everything for a great career. Everything but luck, since for want of opportunities, she failed to live up to her (numerous) capacities. Born in Paris on 30-1927, the daughter of an industrialist and a stay-at-home mother, passionate about piano and classical music, Danielle inherited her artistic flair from the latter. Thanks to Mrs. Godet, the little girl studied and piano and dance, going as far as to win a first prize at the Léopold Belland dance contest. But it was the call of the movies she was actually going to heed. Her first contact with the seventh art was due to chance, as the small village in which she and her parents spent their Summer holidays of 1943 harbored the shooting of Le homme Sans Nom (1943), directed by Léon Mathot. Extras were needed and the pretty sixteen-year old was noticed and hired as one. Some time later, she took drama lessons with Maria Ventura and Jean Martinelli. Her first break came with René Clair who tested her for Man About Town (1947) but all she was given was a bit as a spectator, the great French director having preferred Marcelle Derrien instead. The same mishap occurred to her two years later when, after being considered by Henri-Georges Clouzot for Manon (1949), she was replaced by Cécile Aubry. In 1947, though, she starred alongside a beginner named Yves Montand but it was in an indifferent and now forgotten boxing movie, The Idol (1948). Where she really made an impression was in Henri Calef's Sorceror (1950), also a forgotten (but much better) film. Danielle Godet showed in this noir thriller (not unworthy of I Confess (1953)) that she could be given other roles than the ingénues she had played until then. It was also nice to see her, like other Gallic beauties such as Anne Vernon and Odile Versois, appear in an English movie The Fighting Pimpernel (1949). But from then on, Danielle Godet's artistic fall started and despite her efforts to find worthwhile roles, never ended. In the batch, there are a few unpretentious but entertaining French or Spanish B movies (Votre dévoué Blake (1954), The Versailles Affair (1960), Cuatro en la frontera (1958), Autopsy of a Criminal (1963)...) but what a lot of turkeys signed Maurice de Canonge, Henri Lepage, Walter Kapps, Georges Jaffé or Gianfranco Parolini. A few collaborations with Jean-Pierre Mocky, Jean Dewever, Mauro Bolognini, Juan Luis Buñuel, barely save her honor. What a pity Danielle Godet's path did cross that of Jean Renoir, Jean-Pierre Melville, Claude Autant-Lara, Louis Malle, Jacques Becker and other such high caliber names of French cinema. This comment would for sure have been quite different.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000603	"On January 30, 1937, renowned theatre actor Michael Redgrave was performing in a production of Hamlet in London. During the curtain call, the show's lead, Laurence Olivier, announced to the audience: "tonight a great actress was born". This was in reference to his co-star's newborn daughter, Vanessa Redgrave.Vanessa was born in Greenwich, London, to Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, both thespians. Three quarters of a century after her birth (despite numerous ups and down) this rather forward expectation has definitely been lived up to with an acclaimed actress that has won (among many others) an Academy Award, two Emmys, two Golden Globes, two Cannes Best Actress awards, a Tony, a Screen Actors Guild award, a Laurence Olivier theatre award and a BAFTA fellowship.Growing up with such celebrated theatrical parents, great expectations were put on both herself, her brother Corin Redgrave and sister Lynn Redgrave at an early age. Shooting up early and finally reaching a height just short of 6 foot, Redgrave initially had plans to dance and perform ballet as a profession. However she settled on acting and entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954 and four years later made her West End debut. In the decade of the 1960s she developed and progressed to become one of the most noted young stars of the English stage and then film. Performances on the London stage included the classics: 'A Touch of Sun', 'Coriolanus', 'A Midsummer's Night Dream', 'All's Well that Ends Well', 'As You Like It', 'The Lady from the Sea', 'The Seagull' and many others. By the mid 1960s, she had booked various film roles and matured into a striking beauty with a slim, tall frame and attractive face. In 1966 she made her big screen debut as the beautiful ex-wife of a madman in an Oscar nominated performance in the oddball comedy Morgan! (1966), as well as the enigmatic woman in a public park in desperate need of a photographer's negatives in the iconic Blow-Up (1966) and briefly appeared in an unspoken part of Anne Boleyn in the Best Picture winner of the year A Man for All Seasons (1966).She managed to originate the title role in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" the same year on the London stage (which was then adapted for the big screen a few years later, but Maggie Smith was cast instead and managed to win an Oscar for her performance). Her follow up work saw her play the lead in the box office hit adaptation Camelot (1967), a film popular with audiences but dismissed by critics, and her second Academy Award nominated performance as Isadora Duncan in the critically praised Isadora (1968).Her rise in popularity on film also coincided with her public political involvement, she was one of the lead faces in protesting against the Vietnam war and lead a famous march on the US embassy, was arrested during a Ban-the-Bomb demonstration, publicly supported Yasar Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and fought for various other human rights and particularly left wing causes. Despite her admirably independent qualities, most of her political beliefs weren't largely supported by the public. In 1971 after 3 films back to back, Redgrave suffered a miscarriage (it would have been her fourth, after Natasha Richardson, Joely Richardson and Carlo Gabriel Nero) and a break up with her then partner and father of her son, Franco Nero. This was around the same time her equally political brother Corin introduced her to the Workers Revolutionary Party, a group who aimed to destroy capitalism and abolish the monarchy. Her film career began to suffer and take the back seat as she became more involved with the party, twice unsuccessfully attempting to run as a party member for parliament, only obtaining a very small percentage of votes.In terms of her film career at the time, she was given probably the smallest part in the huge ensemble who-dunnit hit, Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and given another thankless small part as Lola Deveraux in the Sherlock Holmes adventure The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976).After a celebrated Broadway debut, she created further controversy in 1977 with her involvement in two films, firstly in Julia (1977) where she acted opposite Jane Fonda as a woman fighting Nazi oppression and narrated and featured in the documentary The Palestinian (1977) where she famously danced holding a Kalashnikov rifle. She publicly stated her condemnation of what she termed "Zionist hudlums", which outraged Jewish groups and as a result a screening of her documentary was bombed and Redgrave was personally threatened by the Jewish Defense League (JDL). Julia (1977) happened to be a huge critical success and Redgrave herself was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Jewish support groups demanded her nomination to be dropped and at the event of the Academy Awards burned effigies of Redgrave and protested and picketed. Redgrave was forced to enter the event via a rear entrance to avoid harm and when she won the award she famously remarked on the frenzy causes as "Zionist hoodlums" which caused the audience to audibly gasp and boo. The speech reached newspapers the next morning and her reputation was further damaged.It came as a surprise when CBS hired her for the part of real life Nazi camp survivor Fania Fenelon in Playing for Time (1980), despite more controversy and protesting (Fenelon herself didn't even want Redgrave to portray her) she won an Emmy for the part and the film was one of the highest rating programs of the year. Her follow up film work to her Oscar had been mostly low key but successful, performances in films such as Yanks (1979), Agatha (1979), The Bostonians (1984), Wetherby (1985) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987) further cemented her reputation as a fine actress and she received various accolades and nominations.However mainly in the 1980s, she focused on TV films and high budget mini-series as well as theatre in both London and New York. She made headlines in 1984 when she sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra for $5 million for wrongful cancellation of her contract because of her politics (she also stated her salary was significantly reduced in Agatha (1979) for the same reason). She became more mainstream in the 1990s where she appeared in a string of high profile films but the parts often underused Redgrave's abilities or they were small cameos/5-minute parts. Highlights included Howards End (1992), Little Odessa (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), as well as her leading lady parts in A Month by the Lake (1995) and Mrs Dalloway (1997).In 2003 she finally won the coveted Tony award for her performance in 'The Long Day's Journey Into Night' and followed up with another two Tony nominated performances on Broadway, her one woman show 'The Year of Magical Thinking' in 2007 and 'Driving Miss Daisy' in 2010 which not only was extended due to high demand, but was also transferred to the West End for an additional three months in 2011.Vanessa continues to lend her name to causes and has been notable for donating huge amounts of her own money for her various beliefs. She has publicly opposed the war in Iraq, campaigned for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, supported the rights of gays and lesbians as well as AIDs research and many other issues. She released her autobiography in 1993 and a few years later she was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She also famously declined the invitation to be made a Dame for her services as an actress. Many have wondered the possible heights her career could have reached if it wasn't for her outspoken views, but being a celebrity and the artificial lifestyle usually attached doesn't seem to interest Redgrave in the slightest.Vanessa has worked with all three of her children professionally on numerous occasions (her eldest daughter, Natasha Richardson tragically died at the age of 45 due to a skiing accident) and in her mid 70s she still works regularly on television, film and theatre, delivering time and time again great performances."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342245	"Slim, pixie-like, two-time Tony Award winner Tammy Grimes who put on marvelously quirky Cowardesque airs and captivated audiences with her inimitably throaty, raspy voice was actually not British but born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on January 30, 1934, the daughter of Eola Willard (née Niles), a naturalist and spiritualist, and Luther Nichols Grimes, an innkeeper, country-club manager, and farmer. She attended the all-girls Beaver Country Day School in nearby Chestnut Hill and later received entry at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, before relocating to New York for professional acting purposes.Grimes studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse and made her NY debut there in "Jonah and the Whale" in 1955. Broadway offers came shortly after, first as a standby for Kim Stanley as Cherie in "Bus Stop" in June 1955. In 1956, she appeared in the off-Broadway production "The Littlest Revue," performed in a cross-country tour of "The Lark," made an Obie-winning appearance in the off-Broadway play "Clerambard," and in 1959 nabbed the lead role in Noël Coward's play "Look After Lulu!" on Broadway after the renowned playwright discovered her distinctive style of singing at Julius Monk's Downstairs at the Upstairs nightclub in New York. She won a Theatre World Award for that. She later was guest star at the New York City Opera in a revival of "The Cradle will Rock," recreating the role of Moll. On the classical side, Tammy starred with the American Shakespeare Festival at Stratford, Connecticut, as Mistress Quickly in "Henry IV", and Mopsa in 'The Winter's Tale".Earning the role of the indomitable, rags-to-riches, Titanic-surviving Molly Brown in the 1960 musical comedy "The Unsinkable Molly Brown", Grimes won a Tony Award as "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" (due to below the title rules at the time). She followed this with the 1963 play "Rattle of a Simple Man" in 1963. On TV she appeared twice on the popular series "Route 66" and is fondly remembered for her performance in four TV specials: "Four for Tonight" with Cyril Ritchard, Beatrice Lillie and Tony Randall; "Hollywood Sings" with Eddie Albert; "The Datchet Diamonds" with Rex Harrison, and Play of the Week: Archy and Mehitabel (1960) with Eddie Bracken.The role of Samantha in Bewitched (1964) went to Elizabeth Montgomery and the series was a smash hit.1966-67 were tepid years for the actress. After "Bewitched", Grimes finally received her own ABC television series, The Tammy Grimes Show (1966), playing a wealthy heiress but the show was not well-received and dropped quickly, making it one of the shortest series shown in TV history. That same year she was featured in her first film, Three Bites of the Apple (1967), a diverting comedy starring British actor David McCallum and Italian actress Sylva Koscina. The film helped showcase Grimes's quirky talents, but it made no impression on the public and pretty much put the bite on a leading lady career. Later she was sporadically and sometimes bizarrely featured into such films as Play It As It Lays (1972), Somebody Killed Her Husband (1978), The Runner Stumbles (1979), America (1986), Mr. North (1988), Slaves of New York (1989), A Modern Affair (1995), and High Art (1998).Grimes became the toast of New York when she appeared in a revival of Noël Coward's "Private Lives" as "Amanda", winning her second Tony Award, this time for "Best Actress". During her career, she also spent several seasons at the Stratford Festival in Canada. In addition to night clubs, she has also recorded several albums of songs, recited poetry, and hosted CBS Radio Mystery Theater.In 2003, Grimes was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame and later that year was invited by The Noel Coward Society (she later became its vice president) to be the first celebrity to lay flowers on the statue of Sir Coward at The Gershwin Theatre in Manhattan to celebrate the playwright's 104th birthday. In 2007, the septuagenarian returned to the cabaret stage in a critically acclaimed one-woman show at the Plush Room, "An Evening with Miss Tammy Grimes."Grimes was married three times. First to actor Christopher Plummer in August 1956, by whom she had actress Amanda Plummer. The couple were divorced in 1960. Her second husband was actor Jeremy Slate, whose marriage in 1966 lasted but a year. Her 1971 union to Canadian composer Richard Jameson Bell, was a great success and lasted until his death in 2005.Tammy Grimes died on October 30, 2016, aged 82, in Englewood, New Jersey, from undisclosed causes. She was survived by her brother, Luther Nichols "Nick" Grimes Jr., and her Tony-winning actress/daughter Amanda."

He spent a big part of his childhood among drawing blogs and encyclopedias of fauna. After a few years in a drawing and painting academy (1990 -1998), he earned his high school diploma with a focus on Arts and then started Fine Arts at the University of Barcelona. It was then when he started, along with Manel Soto, his first business, a graphic design studio with projects for companies like Filmax, Chesterfield International, Sitges Film Festival and Canal+, and specialized in photography (2001-2007).After this period, he focused on photography and developed his first conceptual series and video works. Shortly after, he joined the company DDT SFX (Academy Award for Pan's Labyrinth) as a conceptual designer doing work for films like Pedro Almodovar's "The Skin I Live In" and J. A. Bayona's "The Impossible".In 2013 he founded Nieve (www.quenieve.com), an audiovisual production company which has helped him develop photography and video projects in the fields of architecture, fashion, advertisement and music videos, along with a team of professionals that have also joined the company. That same year he created a collection of digital illustrations called Zoo Portraits (www.zooportraits.com), consisting of anthropomorphic animal depictions, that went viral online, reaching the world press in a very short time (Huffington Post, Time Out, CBS News, Daily Mail, ABC News, Daily Record, among others). The collection was developed with Isabelle Bazsó as Brand manager, and it is currently a registered trademark and independent project granting permits to other partner companies to commercially use the images on their products. The project also starts an approach to raise awareness and protect the animal kingdom with the help of organizations already working in the field, which gives Yago Partal the opportunity to become involved in his other big passion: the animal kingdom.ExhibitionsSpain - Apr/Jun 2016 - "Luz Profunda" - Rec.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2799890	"Pierre J. Capretz was the creator of the popular French language instruction program "French In Action", that continues to be shown on many public television stations.Born in 1925 in Mazamet, France, Capretz attended the University of Paris. He arrived in the United States, specifically in Gainesville, Florida in 1949, on an army boat. The morning after his arrival, he began teaching Latin at the University of Florida, eventually moving on to teach French. In 1956, Capretz went on to become a professor at Yale University until his retirement in 2003, after which he moved back to France. During his tenure at Yale, he developed the "French In Action" method, where rather than have students learn the standard way of simply studying from textbooks, they would be immersed with visual and audio context of the courses by using pictures of France and recordings.In 1985, filming began on the "French In Action" series (later airing on most PBS stations in 1987). The 52-episode lighthearted series tells the story of a young couple falling in love while traveling throughout France while dealing with everyday life, family and friends. When the storyline ends in each episode, Capretz becomes a guide and mentor by instructing grammar lessons through recaps of the previously shown scenes. The entire course (sans the orientation episode) is spoken only in French. After his retirement, he continued working on a third edition of "French in Action" as well as other projects. In 2012, he attended a reunion for the 25th anniversary of the "FIA" series, featuring those involved in the PBS production.Professor Capretz passed away on April 2, 2014 at the age of 89, in Aix-en-Provence, France.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382957	"Seymour Hicks was an extremely successful actor and theatrical impresario who flourished from the late 19th century into the 1930s. He was best remembered for his portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol".Born on January 30, 1871 on the Isle of Jersey, he first trod the boards as a professional at the age of sixteen. He became a musical-comedy star in London in 1894 in "The Shop Girl", which he followed up with "The Circus Girl" (1896) and "A Runaway Girl" (1898), both of which co-starred his wife Ellaline Terriss, whom he had married in 1893.After the turn of the century, Hicks began writing musical comedies that he and his wife appeared in. These efforts were met with great success. With his earnings from his successful career, he built the Aldwych Theatre in 1905 and the Seymour Hicks Theatre in 1906. (The Hicks was renamed the Globe Theatre in 1909 and eventually the Gielgud Theatre in 1994.) The first production at the Aldwych, Hicks' own musical comedy "The Beauty of Bath", was a hit. Jerome Kern was the composer and P.G. Wodehouse gained his first paying job as a writer on the musical. Wodeouse would be credited with the lyrics to two songs on another Hicks musical, "The Gay Gordons", in 1907.(Hicks also was instrumental in "discovering" the young Alfred Hitchcock. When the director Hugh Croise walked off the set of the 1923 short Always Tell Your Wife (1923), based on a play by Hicks, produced by his Seymour Hicks Productions, the actor enlisted Hitchcock to finish directing it. It was only the second directing gig for Hitchcock, and though he was uncredited, it was his first film to be screened. (Hitch's first movie, Number 13 (1922), was never completed.))By the time of the "Always Tell Your Wife" movie, Hicks had successfully navigated the change in theatrical tastes brought about by the Great War. He had begun writing and appearing in light, escapist comedies and satiric farces. Many of the farces he put on in the 1920s were adapted from French plays. Eventually, as his star waned, he worked in music halls.It was in 1901 that Hicks first played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, the role for which he was most famous. He appeared in "A Christmas Carol" thousands of times on stage and made two movie versions of the Charles Dickens classic, a silent film (Old Scrooge (1913)) in 1913 and a talkie (Scrooge (1935)) in 1935.By the mid-'30s, he was a well-established and highly respected actor and theatrical impresario. He became the 13th actor to become knighted in 1934, which came three years after the French Republic awarded him the Legion of Honor in recognition of his services in promoting French theater in England. (In 1915, he had won the French Croix de Guerre for entertaining Allied troops in France during in World War One and would win his second Croix de Guerre in World War II for the same service to the Allies.)Seymour Hicks died on April 6, 1949 in Hampshire, England. He was 78 years old. He had continued appearing on stage and in movies until the year before his death."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000432	"Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Anna Lyda Elizabeth (Gray) and Eugene Ezra Hackman, who operated a newspaper printing press. He is of Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry, partly by way of Canada, where his mother was born. After several moves, his family settled in Danville, Illinois. Gene grew up in a broken home, which he left at the age of sixteen for a hitch with the US Marines. Moving to New York after being discharged, he worked in a number of menial jobs before studying journalism and television production on the G.I. Bill at the University of Illinois. Hackman would be over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. Legend says that Hackman and friend Dustin Hoffman were voted "least likely to succeed."Hackman next moved back to New York, where he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway. In 1964 he was cast as the young suitor in the Broadway play "Any Wednesday." This role would lead to him being cast in the small role of Norman in Lilith (1964), starring Warren Beatty. When Beatty was casting for Bonnie and Clyde (1967), he cast Hackman as Buck Barrow, Clyde Barrow's brother. That role earned Hackman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, an award for which he would again be nominated in I Never Sang for My Father (1970). In 1972 he won the Oscar for his role as Detective Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in The French Connection (1971). At 40 years old Hackman was a Hollywood star whose work would rise to new heights with Night Moves (1975) and Bite the Bullet (1975), or fall to new depths with The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Eureka (1983). Hackman is a versatile actor who can play comedy (the blind man in Young Frankenstein (1974)) or villainy (the evil Lex Luthor in Superman (1978)). He is the doctor who puts his work above people in Extreme Measures (1996) and the captain on the edge of nuclear destruction in Crimson Tide (1995). After initially turning down the role of Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992), Hackman finally accepted it, as its different slant on the western interested him. For his performance he won the Oscar and Golden Globe and decided that he wasn't tired of westerns after all. He has since appeared in Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Wyatt Earp (1994), and The Quick and the Dead (1995)."
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0658072	Palme came from an upper class family in Stockholm. While studying at the college of Stockholm he got involved in student politics and got the opportunity to travel through post-war Europe in 1949. He became president of Sweden's United Student Unions in 1952. When prime minister Tage Erlander needed a secretary in 1953 he appointed Palme. Palme had an impressive work capacity and also joined the Young Social Democrat's council in 1955. In 1958 he became member of the Parliament, and during this time he was in favor of a Swedish nuclear bomb. He kept the job as Erlander's secretary until 1963 when he was appointed cabinet minister. He made USA furious when he joined a demonstration against the Vietnam war together with North Vietnam's ambassador to Moscow. In 1969 he became leader of his party and prime minister. His starring in I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) led to calls for his resignation because of Lena Nyman taking a bath in the nude. The recession during the 1970s and the debate about nuclear power stations made it anything but an envious position to lead the country and the Social Democrats lost the election in 1976. As leader of the opposition, Palme increased his international work: trying to solve the Iran-Iraq war and nuclear disarmament in Europe. He became prime minister again in 1982, having to make cutbacks in the public finances and trying to downplay the trade union's demands for collective ownership of private companies. He was murdered while walking home from a movie theater with his wife, having seen Bröderna Mozart (1986). Although having been in politics for more than 30 years, and dominating it for 15 years, his memory has almost disappeared from the public consciousness.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402558	"Popular British character actress known for her rich cluster of queens, dowagers, shrews and evildoers, Martita Hunt was born on a ranch in Argentina to British parents, but moved with her family to England at age 10 for her formal education. On stage at age 21 with the Liverpool Repertory Theatre, she grew in stature as a dramatic actress with the Old Vic before expanding her sights to include film in the 30s. Her imposing glare and fervent gait reminded one of the equally horsey-looking Edna May Oliver, and lent itself to a number of scene-stealing supports in such top-quality British efforts as When Knights Were Bold (1936), Nine Days a Queen (1936), The Mill on the Floss (1936), and The Wicked Lady (1945). But it was her brilliant performance as the mad, reclusive Miss Havisham in the classic period piece Great Expectations (1946) that earned her international recognition and Hollywood quickly took notice. More flavorful roles came her way in the post-war years, both regal and ravaged, with Anastasia (1956), Becket (1964) and The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) the highlights. In 1949, she won a Broadway Tony award for her "The Madwoman of Chaillot". Martita Hunt died at age 69 of natural causes in London."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542720	"Delbert Mann, the Oscar-winning film director, was born Delbert Martin Mann Jr. in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1920. His father moved the family to Nashville, Tennesse, after taking a teaching position at Scarritt College. The young Mann graduated from Vanderbilt University, where he met his future wife, Ann Caroline Gillespie. He developed a lifelong friendship with Fred Coe, whom he met at the Nashville Community Playhouse, that would prove critical in his professional life.After his 1941 graduation from Vanderbilt, Mann joined the Army and was assigned to the Air Corps, eventually becoming a pilot with the 8th Air Force. As a B-24 pilot with the "Mighty Eighth," Mann flew 35 bombing missions in the European Theater of Operations. After being demobilized at the end of the war, his interest changed to another type of theater, and he attended the Yale Drama School. From Yale he moved on to a directing job with the Town Theatre of Columbia, South Carolina.His old friend Fred Coe, a producer at NBC, offered Mann the opportunity to direct live television drama on the network's The Philco Television Playhouse (1948). Mann accepted the job offer and moved to New York in 1949. For NBC he directed many dramas for the "Philco Playhouse," which later alternated its broadcasting weeks on the network with the Goodyear Playhouse (1951) and Producers' Showcase (1954) (television programs in the early days typically had one major commercial sponsor; thus, many programs from the early days bore the name of that primary sponsor). Mann directed episodes for all three showcases, including "October Story" with actress Julie Harris and actress Leslie Nielsen, "Middle of the Night" with actree Eva Marie Saint and actor E.G. Marshall, a remake of The Petrified Forest (1936), and even two productions of William Shakespeare's "Othello" (one of which featured the unlikely Walter Matthau as Iago!).Mann was one of the best-known graduates of "The Golden Age of Television," when live original drama was a staple of network TV. Other showcases he worked for included NBC Repertory Theatre (1949), Ford Star Jubilee (1955) and Playwrights '56 (1955). In 1953 he directed a live teleplay written by another WWII vet, Paddy Chayefsky. The episode of "Goodyear Television Playhouse" starring another vet, the up-and-coming Method actor Rod Steiger, as a lonely butcher named "Marty."Delbert Mann's name will always be linked to the extraordinary cultural phenomenon that was "Marty," but it was as a film, not as television program, that Chayevsky's 1953 script became legendary, the first blockbuster hit of independent cinema. However, Mann's first recognition from the culture industry didn't come from Chayevsky's "Marty," either on television or film, but from Thornton Wilder's theatrical warhorse about a small burg in New Hampshire, "Our Town."In 1954, Mann won a Best Director Emmy nomination for the "Producers' Showcase" episode "Our Town," a musical adaptation featuring the young Paul Newman and the singing talents of swinging Frank Sinatra. Ironically, the TV play of "Marty," considered the summit of TV's Golden Age in retrospect, went unrecognized during the nascent industry's awards season, though it did receive an excellent buzz via word of mouth. (The live "Marty" was captured via kinescope, a method of reproduction that involved shooting a 16-mm copy of the broadcast off of a TV monitor for rebroadcast to the West Coast in the days before coast-to-coast TV hookups, let along videotape; such programs were seldom rebroadcast after the initial showing due to the poor quality of the 'scope.) That situation would change once "Marty" moved from New York to Hollywood.It's said that superstar Burt Lancaster and his producing partner Ben Hecht were looking for a property to generate a tax write-off for their successful indie production company, Hecht-Lancaster. That property was Marty, shot in B+W in the standard Academy ratio of 4:3 in an era when the blockbuster, like Cecil B. DeMIlle's epic remake of "The Ten Commandments," shot in color in the wide-screen processes of CinemaScope, Cinerama and VistaVision, were all the rage. (The box office gross of the 1956 "Ten Commandments," if adjusted for inflation, would rival the grosses generated by the top block busters of the present era.) Color, widescreens and spectacle were considered to be the necessary ingredients to get people out of the house where they were planted in front of the TV and back into the theaters. And here was a low-budget, B+W film with no production values and no stars based on a TV play that had appeared free on TV (Hollywood's great enemy) just two years before!Remaking "Marty" seemed an honorable way to generate a tax-write off, so the story goes, while associating the company with quality, but Hecht-Lancaster refused to spend much money on it. The budget was limited to just under $350,000. (It's said that "Marty" was the first Oscar-winning film in which the advertising costs exceeded the budget.) Rod Steiger, who did not want to be bound contractually to Hecht-Lancaster, refused to reprise the eponymous title role, so it was turned over to Burt Lancaster's "From Here to Eternity" co-star, 'Ernest Borginine' . Having assayed Fatso Judson and other screen heavies in his brief cinema career, Borgnine had never played a sympathetic supporting character, let alone a lead, on film before.Possibly due to its unpromising prospects, Burt Lancaster didn't bother putting his name on the picture as a producer, leaving that honor (and the Oscar that lay in "Marty's future) to Hecht. No wonder the success of "Marty" caught everyone flat-footed! It's perhaps the supreme case in Hollywood's checkered flirtation with "quality" cinema that quality not only won out, but more importantly, paid off (and paid off handsomely at that!).The movie "Marty" was a critical success before it was a commercial success. Shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1955, it was the first American film to win the Golden Palm (an award which, in the French manner, is shared by its director). In release, the film returned $3 million in rentals ($21 million in 2005 dollars), which was a considerable amount in the mid-1950s. More importantly for Hecht-Lancaster, its low-budget made "Marty" one of the most profitable movies ever made.The critical recognition and boffo box office made "Marty" a sleeper at the 1956 Academy Awards, at which Mann won the Oscar as Best Director of 1955 and Chayevsky copped the Best Adapted Screenplay trophy. In addition to the original "auteurs," Ernest Borgnine won the Best Actor Oscar and Harold Hecht picked up the gong for Best Picture. Betsy Blair and Joe Mantell also received nominations in Best Supporting Acting categories, and on the technical side, "Marty" was nominated for Best B+W Cinematography (Joseph LaShelle) and Best B+W Art Direction-Set Decoration ( Ted Haworth, Walter M. Simonds, Robert Priestley). Until Sam Mendes duplicated the feat in 2000, Mann was the only director to win an Oscar for his first film.Though he could not know it then, "Marty" was the highpoint of Mann's career. While Chayevsky went on to win two more Oscars, Mann never won another Oscar nomination, though he did pick up two more Emmy nominations in 1972 and 1980 during his productive career. More significantly, Delbert Mann had the respect of his peers: in addition to his three subsequent Directors Guild of America nominations to go along with his win for "Marty," the DGA honored him with its Robert B. Aldrich Achievement Award in 1997 and an Honorary Life Membership in 2002."

In WWE, he is both the on-screen General Manager of 205 Live and the manager of the tag team AOP on Monday Night Raw. He is known for his work with Impact Wrestling and various British and American indies under the ring name Rockstar Spud, a gimmick based on obnoxious 1980s rock stars. He has also wrestled matches as Spud, often as the underdog who defeats much larger wrestlers. He has worked for SAS Wrestling, Frontier Wrestling Alliance, and International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. James Michael Curtin was born in Birmingham on 30 January 1983. He was originally trained by Jack Storm and Chris Gilbert at the K-Star Wrestling promotion in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham, before eventually coming under the tutelage of "Charming" Don Charles at the SAS Wrestling Academy. Under the ring name Spud, he went on to perform in many independent promotions within the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. While on the independent circuit, Spud's first major appearances came with the Revolution British Wrestling promotion in 2003. On 30 August 2003, Spud defeated Jack Hazard to become RBW's first British Welterweight Champion, a title he held for several months before losing it to "The Gift" Ross Jordan in an Iron Man match in December 2003. Spud began working for Frontier Wrestling Alliance in 2004, and was brought up into the main roster to be used as a jobber for a short time, competing against many larger opponents. During the start of 2005, however, FWA began showcasing their flyweight division; later that year, Spud entered into a tournament to crown a Flyweight Champion. He made it to the tournament final, where he was defeated by Ross Jordan, who became the first FWA Flyweight Champion. However, Jordan was only awarded the match after the referee stopped the contest due to a kayfabe injury to Spud's leg.The pair continued to feud for over 14 months, with Jordan repeatedly attacking Spud in attempts to re-injure his leg. The feud ended when Spud defeated Jordan in a Last Man Standing match at FWA Last Fight at the Prom on 30 September 2006. urtin signed with WWE in October 2017, but had to postpone his debut until his U.S. work visa was renewed.

At the Survivor Series pay-per-view, Maverick was once again in the corner of AOP, this time helping to lead them to victory over The Bar, as Maverick distracted the opposing team after relieving himself out of fear from The Bar's manager, Big Show. On 10 December episode of Raw, AOP lost their tag titles to Bobby Roode and Chad Gable in a three-on-two handicap match, that also involved Maverick. While acting as a heel on the main roster, Maverick remained acting as a face General Manager on 205 Live.

The young Martin was a writer for the popular radio sit-com "Duffy's Tavern" before teaming up with Rowan in the 1950s. The duo achieved success playing the nightclub circuit and Las Vegas, leading to Martin's being cast in a recurring role on The Lucy Show (1962) as series start Lucille Ball's next door neighbor "Harry Conners" when Lucy's new series debuted in 1962, Martin remained as a regular on "Lucy" through the 1963-64 season.As the success of their act increased, Rowan & Martin began making appearances on TV during the 1960s. In 1966, the duo were cast as the co-hosts for the The Dean Martin Summer Show (1966) on NBC. The following year, when NBC decided it wanted a new comic variety show that would have cross-generational appeal, producers Ed Friendly and George Schlatter hired Rowan & Martin to co-host a one-time special, "Laugh-In", that would serve as a pilot for the potential series. The special was a success, and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967) debuted the following year. It was a smash hit, proving to be one of the top-rated shows of the late 1960s, and had a huge impact on American pop culture during the first years of its five-year run. The series was canceled in 1973.In 1969, Rowan & Martin made an attempt to recapture the small-screen magic of "Laugh-In" on the big screen, but The Maltese Bippy (1969) was a flop. After the cancellation of their series, Rowan & Martin generally parted ways, professionally, as Dan Rowan was a diabetic and limited his work. Like Rowan, Martin became a frequent panelist on game shows such as Match Game (1973). He also hosted the Mindreaders (1979) game show in 1979, but the show was not a success. Martin eventually launched a new career as a TV director, serving as the chief director of the 1980s sitcom, Newhart (1982).On the personal front, Martin was most known for his two marriages to Playboy Playmate of the Year Dolly Read (1971-75; 1978-present). Martin's first wife was the former Peggy Connelly, by whom he had two sons, Richard Martin, Jr. and Cary Martin."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334220	"A versatile and accomplished young amateur actress, Grace Hayward became a professional before she was 20. Her parents, George and Alida (Carpenter) Hayward, moved from Terre Haute, Indiana, where Grace was born, to Mt. Carmel, Ill. when Grace was in high school. During the 1890s she performed with "Ferris Comedians," a traveling troupe, and eventually married Richard Ferris, the head of the company. Ferris promoted her for a time as "The Grace Hayward Company." When her marriage began to disintegrate, Hayward formed her own repertory company, traveling around the theater-vaudville circuit, presenting and acting in plays, many of which she wrote. In 1902, she acquired the rights to "Graustark: The Story of a Love Behind the Throne," a best-selling novel by George Barr McCutcheon, and dramatized it. She did the same for "St. Elmo" and "Truxton King." All three were made into motion pictures but it is unclear as to whether Hayward's dramatizations were used in the productions. After she and Ferris divorced, she married George Mahan Gatts. During the Twenties and early Thirties, Hayward and Gatts toured the country presenting many of her original plays. One of them was "Her Unborn Child," which opened at Etlinge's 42nd Street Theater in New York on March 5, 1928. After the motion picture was made, Hayward published a novelization of the story. During the Depression, she was commissioned to write a play for Civilian Conservation Corps camps. It was titled, "The CCC Murder Mystery," and reputedly was presented at least 1,000 times. The Gatts retired to Los Angeles, probably in the early forties. George died on April 8, 1949, and Grace died January 7, 1959 at age 90."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0553349	"Elsa Martinelli was born in the central Tuscan city of Grosseto into a struggling family, one of eight siblings. She had to earn her keep from the age of twelve, delivering groceries in Rome. Looking older than her years suggested, she then did some part time work as a bar maid. Aged sixteen and ambitious, she moved on to modelling and was soon promoted by well known designers, and, in particular, by a New York magazine editor who suggested a move to the Big Apple. While employed with the Eileen Ford Agency, she was spotted on a Life magazine cover by none other than Kirk Douglas (or by Douglas's wife, according to another version of the story) who, incidentally, happened to own a fashion company. In any case, Elsa soon found herself in Hollywood to co-star opposite Douglas in The Indian Fighter (1955) (despite some as yet unresolved problems with her command of English). Her sojourn in tinseltown was short-lived, however, and the contract she had signed with Douglas was quietly annulled -- and thus she famously spurned an opportunity to appear in the lucrative blockbuster Spartacus (1960). There were to be no further American pictures at this time. Instead, she returned to Italy, married Count Franco Mancinelli Scotti di San Vito, joined the glitterati, attended lavish parties and created an image for herself which rivalled those of Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida. She counted Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas among her close friends.Taken under the wing of Carlo Ponti, Elsa was able to eventually make a success of her screen career not merely because of her exotic good looks, but by deliberately varying the type of parts she took on and thereby avoid typecasting. Those included the titular Stowaway Girl (1957) who bewitches an embittered steamboat captain played by Trevor Howard. In stark contrast, she was also Carmilla, possessed by her vampiric ancestor Millarca in the unsatisfactorily filmed Blood and Roses (1960), an 'art house' horror movie, though artlessly directed by Roger Vadim, based on Sheridan Le Fanu's Gothic novella. Encumbered by excessive bathos, neither scary nor original, the only saving grace of the picture was derived from Claude Renoir's evocative camera work.In Hatari! (1962) -- which might aptly be described as a good-looking travelogue -- Elsa co-starred as a freelance wildlife photographer on a Tanganyika game farm, torn between affections for baby elephants and 'bring-'em-back-alive' trapper John Wayne. With character development sorely lacking, the animals, the scenery (and two exquisitely ornamental ladies -- the other being Michèle Girardon) pretty much stole the show. Likewise, in her next outing, the wartime comedy The Pigeon That Took Rome (1962), Elsa was the romantic (mostly decorative) interest of Charlton Heston's army guy smuggled into Nazi-occupied Rome in 1944 to extract and send back secret military information via carrier pigeon. For the remainder of the 60's, Elsa appeared in a number of international co-productions which included a segment in The Oldest Profession (1967) as a Roman Emperor's wife discovered in a brothel; and as a gangster's daughter helping a bumbling American treasury agent in Rome (played by Dustin Hoffman in his first starring role) to recover Madigan's Millions (1968).In 1968, Elsa married Paris Match photographer and furniture designer Willy Rizzo. Having already invested some of her earnings from film work into Roman and Parisian real estate, Elsa began to diversify into designing avant garde furniture with apparently mixed success. By the 1980's, she was active as an interior designer in Rome while still making sporadic screen appearances, primarily in TV series. Described by the newspaper La Repubblica as "an icon of style and elegance", Elsa Martinelli died on July 8 2017 in Rome at the age of 82."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740483	"Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, to James and Sara Roosevelt. His father was 54 at the time of FDR's birth and already had a grown son, nicknamed "Rosy". Sarah was only 27 when FDR was born. Growing up, FDR had a happy but sheltered childhood. His family was very wealthy and FDR had a very privileged upbringing, with trips to Europe and private tutors. Sara Roosevelt was a loving but domineering and overprotective mother. FDR was a devoted son, but found clever and subtle ways to get around his mother's domination. At 14 he was sent to Groton, an exclusive prep school led by the Rev. Endicott Peabody. FDR did not enjoy his time at Groton, often being teased by the other kids for having a formal and stuffy manner. Since he had a nephew who was older than him, kids at Groton called him "Uncle Frank". He graduated from Groton in 1900 and went to Harvard, where he edited the "Crimson" but failed to be accepted into the Porcellian Social Club. He graduated Harvard in 1903. Soon after that he fell madly in love with his sixth cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt. They married in 1905, with President Theodore Roosevelt giving the bride away. However, from the start Franklin and Eleanor's marriage was not a happy one. She was quiet and shy, whereas he was boisterous and outgoing. The fact that his mother moved into the house next door to theirs, and ran things, did not help. Franklin and Eleanor had six children (one child died in infancy). In 1910 Franklin was elected to the New York State Legislature from Duchess County. There he made a name for himself as a crusading reformer who favored the "average guy" over big business and championed for honest government. In 1913 he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy and served under Josephus Daniels and President Woodrow Wilson. In 1918 he began a love affair with his wife's social secretary, Lucy Mercer. When Eleanor discovered the affair, she was understandably devastated and told Franklin she wanted a divorce. At the urging of his mother, Frankilin chose to save the marriage and promised Eleanor that he would never have anything more to do with Lucy. The damage was done, however, and Franklin and Eleanor never again shared the intimacies of marriage, becoming more like political partners. In 1921 FDR was stricken with polio and paralyzed. He permanently lost the use of his legs, but refused to let that thwart his political ambitions. He spoke at the 1924 Democratic Convention for the candidacy of Alfred E. Smith, then the Governor of New York, calling him the "Happy Warrior". In 1928 FDR was elected Governor of New York and was well placed when the stock market crashed in 1929. As governor he took the lead in providing relief and public works projects for the millions of unemployed in the state. His success as New York's governor made him a strong candidate for the Presidency in 1932. He easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover.When Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as President on March 4, 1933, more than 15 million Americans were unemployed. Millions more had been hard hit by the Depression and the banking system had collapsed. FDR wasted no time in launching a radical economic recovery program, known as the New Deal. He created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which made the federal government the guarantor of people's bank deposits - not the banks themselves - and allowed drought-stricken farmers to refinance their mortgages, He created public works programs including the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)--thus making the government the employer of last resort--as well as setting up the Social Security system, instituting a minimum wage, outlawing child labor--a widespread practice at the time, especially in mines, factories and textile mills--and mandating a 40-hour work week with overtime pay. In responding to the Depression, FDR forever changed the role of the federal government in American life. He was easily reelected in 1936, defeating Republican Alf Landon in a landslide. His second term as president was less successful than his first, however. The Supreme Court had ruled a number of New Deal measures unconstitutional. With an electoral mandate in the bank, FDR proposed "packing" the Supreme Court with justices of his political persuasion for every judge over the age of 70 that did not retire. However, Congress refused to pass the Supreme Court packing plan, and from that point on FDR was unable to get Congress to pass much of his legislation. Also, fascism was rising rapidly throughout Europe and Asia. Germany's Adolf Hitler and Italy's Benito Mussolini had both seized power and began to conquer other countries, such as Ethiopia, Austria and Czechoslavakia. FDR was unable to respond to the threats from Europe and Asia, however, because sentiment in the US was strongly isolationist and Congress had passed a series of neutrality laws that gave the President very little power to respond to international aggression. World War II began in September 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland. Nine months later all of Western Europe had fallen to Hitler. The UK and its Commonwealth and Empire was standing alone. FDR wanted to help Britain, but had to move carefully and skillfully. He negotiated a deal in which the US gave Britain 50 old destroyers in exchange for bases in the Western Hemisphere. With World War II underway, FDR took the unprecedented move of seeking a third term as president. He won that term in November 1940, defeating Republican Wendell Willkie. Safely re-elected, he proposed a radical new program for helping Britain, known as Lend-Lease, in which Britain could buy armaments and other supplies from the US but not have to pay for them until after the war. FDR used the analogy of borrowing a neighbor's hose to put out a house fire to sell Lend-Lease. It passed and America became the "arsenal of democracy" as it began to build armaments for Britain and then the Soviet Union, when Hitler invaded it in mid-1941. Roosevelt met Britain's Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, for the first time in August 1941 where they drew up the Atlantic Charter. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, destroying much of America's Pacific fleet. The next day,FDR declared war on Japan, calling December 7 "a date that will live in infamy." America was in the war, and not only against Japan, but also against Germany and Italy. Under FDR's leadership, America quickly transformed itself from a decaying nation of idle factories, impoverished families, abandoned farms and masses of hobos roaming the streets to a nation turning out planes, tanks, guns, military vehicles and other armaments on a scale that quickly dwarfed the capability of Nazi Germany to do the same. World War II also changed American life as blacks got better jobs in the war plants and women began working outside the home in unprecedented numbers. Helped by Eleanor, FDR used the war as a vehicle for social progress, securing better treatment for minorities and women, higher wages and better benefits for workers and a GI bill, which guaranteed a free college education for all American soldiers who fought in the war. In so doing, he created the American middle class of today.After a series of military defeats, the US and its allies began to win the war. Invasions of North Africa and Italy were launched and the US started retaking islands in the South Pacific it had lost to Japan at the beginning of the war, starting with the Battle of Midway in 1942. FDR met with Churchill several times throughout the war and with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at Tehran in 1943 and at Yalta in 1945. The Allied invasion of France, known as D-Day, was launched on June 6, 1944. As the war ended, FDR pushed for his dream of a United Nations and for reforms that would ensure that another World War would never happen. The United Nations did come to pass, as well as new global institutions such as the World Bank and IMF. Also, FDR advocated for decolonization of Africa and Asia, leading to the collapse of the old European empires.Because of the war, FDR felt he had no right to leave the presidency while Americans under his command were still fighting. So he sought a fourth term in 1944. His opponent was the new governor of New York, Thomas E. Dewey, who ran a campaign of innuendo, hinting that FDR was too ill to lead and that his government had gone stale. FDR retaliated with a speech accusing the Republicans of attacking his dog, Fala. FDR won his fourth term in November 1944. In January 1945 he journeyed to Yalta to confer with Churchill and Stalin for the last time, to settle the postwar world and push for Russian participation in the United Nations. By this time FDR was gravely ill. After the Yalta Conference, he traveled to his resort at Warm Springs, Georgia, where he died suddenly of a massive stroke on April 12, 1945. It was revealed that Lucy Mercer, his one-time lover, was with him when he died and that she had secretly visited him in the White House a number of times during his last year.There was an elaborate funeral for him, with a train procession from Warm Springs to Washington DC, then to Hyde Park, where he was buried."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688318	Independent filmmaker / producer Ilppo Pohjola works with the vocabulary of film, examining its structural and social elements in order to create a body of work that pushes the limits of the medium's physical possibilities. He works between the narrative tropes of Hollywood and the deconstructive methodologies of independent film.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224315	"Rino Di Silvestro was an Italian writer/director who specialized in extremely raw, graphic and, in the opinion of many critics, offensive low-budget exploitation fare. He was born in 1932 and hailed from a family of Sicilian landowners. He established his own avant-garde theatre company and produced the risqué comedy play "Op Bop Pop Nip" in the 1960s. In addition, Di Silvestro was a ghostwriter who penned over 200 screenplays. He made his directorial debut with the supremely scuzzy chicks-in-chains outing Women in Cell Block 7 (1973). He followed that with the sleazy Love Angels (1974) and the nasty Nazisploitation item Deported Women of the SS Special Section (1976). Di Silvestro achieved his greatest enduring cult cinema notoriety, however, with the outrageously trashy and leering soft-core horror schlocker Werewolf Woman (1976).His last two pictures were the typically tawdry Hanna D. - La ragazza del Vondel Park (1984) and the crass sexploitation peplum The Erotic Dreams of Cleopatra (1985).He died of cancer on October 3, 2009."

Three years later he became an instructor in topographical drawing at the University of California. In 1894, however, he made an almost complete 180-degree change from the staid, stable work of drafting and technical drawing to become editor of the humor magazine "Wave" and the next year he became editor of "Lark", a quirky, edgy (for the times) humor magazine. It was there that his famous quatrain--often wrongly attributed to Ogden Nash--"The Purple Cows" appeared: "I never saw a purple cow / I never hope to see one / But I can tell you anyhow / I'd rather see than be one". The magazine also featured his drawings of bizarre, badly behaving creatures called "Goops", which caught on with the public. He wrote a series of books filled with his humorous observations on life in general and the battle of the sexes.He died in Carmel, California, on September 18, 1951."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0657160	"David Pal (born George Sies Pal) was born in Eindhoven, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands, on January 30, 1937, to George and Zsoka Pal.The family lived and worked in Eindhoven by invitation of Philips Radio for whom George Pal made animated film advertisements (which, at that time, were shown in movie theaters). He also created his first Puppetoon films in Eindhoven.In 1939, with a reference from Paramount Pictures which had taken an interest in George's work, the Pals were granted an exit visa to emigrate to America, which they did early in 1940 on the ocean liner, Normandie, which relied on its speed to outdistance any U-Boat near its sea lane.After arriving in New York City, the Pals traveled by train to California and settled in Beverly Hills where George began producing and directing new Puppetoons for the 1940s.In 1941, the Pal family had a new addition in the person of son, and brother, Peter.By the 1950s, George Pal was producing his first full-length feature films that combined live action with increasingly elegant special effects.David attended Los Angeles schools, including the Hollywood Professional School -- a highly-respected school for the children of film makers and film artists and for young people who were already working in some capacity. At the age of 16, he changed his name to George David Pal and expressed his preference to be called simply David Pal.In his mid-teens, David began an 8-year-long interest in motor racing, specializing in the improvement of high-performance motorcycle and automobile engines. He also did paintwork for Von Dutch -- the famous artist and pin striper. Eventually, he became the machine shop foreman at Tattersfield Speed Equipment -- owned by Schraeger Engineering.In his late teens and early 20s, he developed interests in the aesthetics of film -- especially still photography, through a friendship with Ralph Gibson, and also in the use of the animation camera. In this endeavor he worked with Wah Chang and Gene Warren at Projects Unlimited, where he did stop-motion animation on MGM's The Time Machine (1960), "The Cobbler and the Elves" sequence in The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), The Power (1968), and the television shows, Star Trek and The Outer Limits (the original).While in Germany, working on the Brothers Grimm project, he was introduced to the operation and technology of Cinerama's three-strip process by Thomas Conroy, Cinerama's Vice President.Throughout the 1960s, as various wide-screen systems fought for market dominance, David was very much involved in the photographic aspects of film. He tested and evaluated a number of optical and photographic systems, as well as projection and display systems.At Cinerama, he became Assistant Head of the Photographic Department, and, at Cinemiracle, Head of the Photographic Department.After Cinerama acquired the Benson and Lehrner Company, David evaluated the prototypes developed there and tested both experimental 360-degree, wide-screen systems and ultra-high speed cameras.As a part-time director of photography at ABC's Wide World of Sports, he introduced the use of ultra high-speed photography of car and motorcycle races, filmed at 128 to 600 frames per second. He also applied this film method to Evel Knieval's motorcycle stunts, cliff divers in Acapulco, downhill ski races, and air races.At a Fairchild Optical subsidiary, he worked on the development of their new 180-degree field-angle lens and methods of using it. The lens was later used for an exhibit in 70-mm film format at the Seattle World's Fair "Spacarium." He also tested prototypes, designed by Felix Bednarz, for wide-screen motion picture systems.He went on to be a project manager for the New York World's Fair, Government Exhibition, where he designed and prototyped display ideas.At Walt Disney Studios' Camera Department, he worked with Scene Planning and developed a simplified method of numerically calculating camera movements that gave a filmed scene a fluid and natural look.He worked at the CBS Studio Center (formerly Republic Films) Camera Department on such productions as Gunsmoke, The Wild West, Rawhide, Gilligan's Island, Big Valley, and many others.In the 1960s and 70s, David worked on feature films (where, for instance, he developed camera masks to give George Stevens's The Greatest Story Ever Told a "Rennaisance look"). He also worked on several television series, including The Smothers Brothers Show, where he was director of photography for the opener. He also worked on documentaries, commercials, and special effects projects.After working as an art director for MGM-Europe, David worked as art director and animator on the Philips Cavalcade "History of Music" show, produced at Joop Geesink Studios (Amsterdam, Netherlands). He did various commercials for German and Dutch markets, as well as second-unit camera work for MGM Europe, and was on call to do automobile stunts.He was third partner, along with Gene Warren and Wah Chang, at Excelsior Films -- an Academy Award winning special effects company. He did the character and set design for a combined live-action and animated version of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.After leaving the motion picture business in the mid-1970s, David turned his attention to other areas of interest: The design and construction of furniture in partnership with Farhad Ebrahimi, co-owner of Quark Software; the importing of antiques and decorative objects of art from Austria and Hungary -- which required living three months of the year in Vienna; the opening of an Antique Conservation Facility specializing in the conservation (via museums and sales to private collectors) of Biedermier furniture, 18th and 19th Century time pieces, and scientific instruments. In the late 1970s, David was awarded the Burlington House Annual Award for "Best Interior Design."David, now retired, lives in Northern, California with his wife, Mariam.He has four children, Alison, Daniela, Jeff, and Jeremy.Mariam is an accomplished performing cellist specializing in chamber music, and is also a performer of classical mandolin music. She was Manager of the Los Angeles Mandolin Orchestra for over a decade. She is an accomplished painter who's work is frequently exhibited and had a well-known drawing and painting workshop in Los Angeles for 11 years. She is also an avid antique car collector.Alison is in Minnesota, finishing her doctorate in post-war German film.Jeremy is employed by the International Center for the Study of Advanced Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy and has recently accepted a professorship at Loyola University in Los Angeles.Daniela is a Physician's Assistant in cardiac surgery and resides in Phoenix, Arizona.Jeff is an MD working as an anesthesiologist in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.And now (in 2006) David is happily busy pursuing still-photography (including shows which exhibit his pictures), and, as part of his continuing interest in Art History -- classical drawing and painting."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0301145	"Leonid Iovich Gaidai was born on January 30, 1923, in the town of Svobodny, Amur region of Siberia, USSR. He was the third child in the family of a railroad worker. His father, named Iov Isidorovich Gaidai, was exiled to Siberia from Poltava, Ukraine. His mother, named Maria Ivanovna Lubimova, came from the Russian city of Ryazan. In 1930 the family moved to the Siberian city of Irkutsk. There Gaidai went to school and graduated in June of 1941.In 1941, during the Nazi occupation of Russia in the Second World War, Gaidai was drafted in the Red Army. He was assigned to the front-line Army intelligence at the Kalinin Front near Moscow. Because he spoke German, he was involved in clandestine intelligence operations against the Nazi invaders. In 1943 he was seriously wounded, when he stepped on a land mine. He became physically handicapped and was decorated for his courage. He was discharged with honors as a disabled veteran of WWII.Gaidai went back to Siberian city of Irkutsk, There he studied acting at the Drama Studio of the Irkutsk Drama Theatre. He graduated in 1947, and was an actor of that theatre until 1949. From 1949-1955 he studied as film director at State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) under Grigoriy Aleksandrov, Mikhail Romm and Ivan Pyrev. From 1955 Gaidai was a film director at the Mosfilm Studios under his mentor Mikhail Romm. Gaidai used literary material by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov, Mikhail A. Bulgakov, Mikhail Zoschenko, and O. Henry among other writers.His early films of the 1950's had little success. In the 1960's Gaidai created the "goldmine" with comedians Yuriy Nikulin, Georgiy Vitsin, Evgeniy Morgunov, and Aleksandr Demyanenko. Comedies with those actors were the highest-grossing box office hits ever in the Soviet Union with the attendance of 222,800,000 in the first 15 months. Total admissions of the Gaidai's comedies during the 1960's only in the USSR exceeded 600,000,000 without counting the reruns and the international sales.During the 1970s and 1980s Gaidai worked with the best comedians of the Soviet cinema, such as Evgeniy Leonov, Leonid Kuravlyov, Archil Gomiashvili, Mikhail Pugovkin, Yuriy Yakovlev and many other renown actors. Alhough the inevitable changes in society during "perestroika" affected the film industry, Gaidai's films still remained on the top. Gaidai's comedies on video even gained popularity after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a 1995 poll in Russia, 'Brilliantovaya ruka' (1968) was voted the best Russian comedy ever.Financial success did not reach Gaidai personally, he lived in a co-op flat and had the same one car, "Lada", driven by his wife, actress Nina Grebeshkova for many years. She was the fortress behind his success by being a quiet help and never demanding more than they had. She described her husband, Gaidai, as being similar to the popular character 'Shurik' in his films. Leonid Gaidai died of thrombo-embolic disease and complications of his WWII wounds on November 19, 1993, in Moscow. He was laid to rest in the Kuntsevsky Cemetery in Moscow, Russia."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1292366	Having grown up with a love for creative, genre bending television and films, such as the original Doctor Who and Ghostbusters, Andrew Gernhard took his love for fantastical, out-of-the-box storytelling, and turned it into a successful producing career spanning nearly two decades, creating dozens of high concept, yet mainstream accessible films of all genres.Upon graduating from Southern Connecticut State University with a Communication degree, Andrew immediately began working in the video production field, while also producing his first feature film, Trees. A tongue-in-cheek, loving homage to Steven Spielberg's seminal thriller, Jaws, Trees quickly gained a cult following for its irreverent humor among B-movie fans. He followed Trees up with a more ambitious, effects driven sequel, The Root of all Evil, which lead to him forming the production company, Synthetic Cinema International, the following year.Taking advantage of the then burgeoning straight-to-video DVD market, Synthetic Cinema produced a series of economical horror films. During a time when the horror genre was saturated with Eastern inspired ghost films, and bleak torture movies, Synthetic Cinema's brand of fast paced and fun creature features stood out in the crowd, and quickly gained the attention of NBC/Universal's then brand new horror network, Chiller Network.Sensing the waning interest in the home video market, Andrew began producing original films for Chiller Network through Synthetic Cinema. Partnering with popular comic book writer Steve Niles, best known for 30 Days of Night, he produced an adaptation of Niles' zombie graphic novel, Remains, for the network. Starring Grant Bowler and Lance Reddick, Remains was the flagship film for Chiller, and instant ratings hit. The success lead to Synthetic Cinema producing half a dozen original films for the network, including Animal, a co-production with Drew Barrymore's Flower Films starring Joey Lauren Adams and rapper Eve.In 2014, Andrew reached out to a former teacher from his high school, turned New York Times Best Selling Author, Wally Lamb, to produce a feature film adaptation of his popular novel Wishin' and Hopin' for the Lifetime Network. The project quickly gained momentum as an all-star cast signed on, including Molly Ringwald, Cheri Oteri , Meatloaf, and Chevy Chase amongst others. The film, a nostalgic coming of age Christmas film, was praised by critics and audiences alike, and has become a yearly holiday tradition for many families.Andrew has continued to work with the Lifetime Network, producing the modern-day Tell-Tale Heart inspired thriller, The Murder Pact, and working with Melissa Joan Hart on projects like The Santa Con and the highly anticipated remake of Disney's cult classic, The Watcher in the Woods. Synthetic Cinema has continued to grow and thrive, producing numerous feature films a year in Andrew's home state of Connecticut, often employing local crew members and aiding in creating a close-knit film community. Every movie has gone on to secure distribution in numerous territories across the world, making Synthetic Cinema a go-to production house for high quality, universally enjoyable feature films.

As an only child with his over-active imagination, it was not uncommon to find him building skyscrapers, castles or vast alien worlds in his room or in his mind for hours at a time. One summer he and a friend dissected Atari's Pitfall!, mapping out each level to completion on a continuous roll of butcher paper. Growing up in the '70s and 80s, Michael was able to experience virtually every home game console including Sears Pong to ColecoVision, Intellivision, Odyssey, Atari and then on to the C64 and now into the modern era of PC and XBOX/PS3. Geeking it out in his teens (and to this day), he was an avid player and a game master of games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Earthdawn, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu and many others, leading to the creation of many role-playing rule sets and settings both fantasy and futuristic. For the past 25 years he and best friend David Massey have been designing and prototyping games and testing ideas on paper and pixel, starting with their interactive online RPG/BBS "The Underdark" in the early '90s to strategy and RPG computer games today. As an award-winning 2D and 3D artist he hopes to continue his childhood dreams of creating enjoyable games for people to play. More of a gamer than an actor... But he tries.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288	"Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer "Jenny" (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in "The Nerd". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Empire of the Sun (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Little Women (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for "Entertainment Weekly" crowned Bale one of the "Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the "Most Creative People in Entertainment", and "Premiere" lauded him as one of the "Hottest Leading Men Under 30".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Reign of Fire (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and The Machinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer "Irish" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic The Flowers of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children."

He spent most of his early entertainment life as a young actor and model. He played the "Artful Dodger" in the West End production of "Oliver!" alongside the future movie screen "Artful Dodger," Jack Wild. His interest in music and drumming began at school, where he drummed with a stage school band "The Real Thing," subsequently joining "Freehold" and "Flaming Youth." "Flaming Youth" recorded an album to some critical acclaim, although the group disbanded shortly afterward. Collins later successfully auditioned for Genesis, taking over vocals from Peter Gabriel when he left the band in 1975.After separating from his first wife, Collins recorded his first solo album, "Face Value." The album was well received and Collins started to become a household name after the song "In the Air Tonight" was featured on the US TV show Miami Vice (1984). This instigated a guest appearance on the show playing a game show host. His third LP, "No Jacket Required," produced multiple chart hits and awards.Collins is an active musician and entertainer, contributing and guesting regularly on many albums, ranging from Gary Brooker and Camel (Peter Barden's old band) to Eric Clapton. Collins also played as the drummer for the jazz fusion group Brand X and later formed his own big band to play swing and jazz music.Collins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. With over 200 million album sales (when his solo career and Genesis career are combined), Collins is one of the most successful musicians of all time, as well as probably the most successful British pop star to have been consistently overlooked for the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British music.Actress Lily Collins is his daughter (her mother is his second wife, Jill Tavelman)."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741448	"Current ABC/ESPN analyst and former 13-year NBA star Jalen Rose is one of the few professional athletes to maintain a high profile post retirement. Long known for his post-game quotes and great relationship with the media, Jalen continues to show his versatility in the broadcast booth, in the entertainment world and as a philanthropist.Jalen was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he attended Southwestern High School and the University of Michigan. In college he was part of the legendary "Fab Five" where he and his teammates revolutionized the sport of basketball on the court and off by wearing baggy uniform shorts, black socks and black shoes. The first team in Final Four history to ever start five freshmen, they led the Wolverines to back to back NCAA Championship game appearances. In 1994, Jalen was drafted in the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Notable highlights from his thirteen-year NBA career include winning the NBA's "Most Improved Player" and "Player of the Week" awards in 2000 and "Eastern Conference Player of the Week" accolades in 2005. As a member of the Indiana Pacers, his team appeared in three straight eastern conference finals including a trip to the NBA Finals in 2000. In 2003, he was honored with the Professional Basketball Writers Association Magic Johnson Award. Jalen was inducted into the Detroit High School Hall of Fame in 2013 and Michigan Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.While many basketball stars make the transition to the small screen after they hang up their basketball kicks, Jalen made the bold leap in the midst of his NBA career in 2002, becoming a multi-faceted reporter for BET Mad Sports and an on-air personality for Fox Sports Net's famed Best Damn Sports Show Period. Working with the Best Damn Sports Show Period for six years, the budding broadcast star developed his own lifestyle-oriented "Jammin' With Jalen" segment. Shortly after retiring from basketball in 2007, Jalen - a mass communications major at U of M who ultimately earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Maryland University College - went full throttle pursuing his passion in the multi-media, sports and entertainment world, signing with ABC/ESPN as an analyst. Covering a wide range of current events in the landscape of sports, he's appeared on the network's flagship shows SportsCenter, Mike and Mike in the Morning, First Take, SportsNation, Outside the Lines and Numbers Never Lie, as well as the basketball related shows Coast to Coast, NBA Tonight and College Game Day. In 2012, Jalen was named a studio analyst for NBA Countdown - ABC and ESPN's pre-game show.On September 28, 2015, ESPN Radio launched Jalen & Jacoby, a primetime national weekday program (7 -9 p.m.) co-hosted by Rose and ESPN senior producer/commentator David Jacoby. Jalen & Jacoby, which features Rose and Jacoby breaking down the latest news in sports and pop culture, began as a passion project of the same name in 2011 and was promoted to a full show due to its popularity. On January 28, 2016, Jalen & Jacoby added a TV version of their show on ESPN2 which is comprised of segments from the radio show. Their chemistry, catchphrases and devoted following has led them to have the most downloaded sports podcast (per episode) as well as the most watched sport podcast on the internet.In 2015, The Hollywood Reporter named Jalen the most influential media voice in the NBA with the title of "The Smartest Specialist" and Jalen was also voted the #2 most-liked basketball personality in an online poll.In 2000, Jalen established the Jalen Rose Foundation/Charitable Fund to create life-changing opportunities for underserved youth through the development of unique programs and the distribution of grants to qualified nonprofit organizations. Grants focus on education and sports and are distributed in Jalen's hometown of Detroit as well as other communities in need.Jalen's most substantial outreach initiative to date is the establishment of the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy (JRLA). The Academy opened its doors in September 2011 and is an open enrollment, tuition free, public charter high school on the Northwest side of Detroit. The Academy currently serves over 400 ninth through twelfth grade students and graduated its inaugural class in June 2015 - one hundred percent of the Academy's graduates have gained college, trade/technical school or military acceptance. The mission is to provide a leadership-focused experience within a high-performing high school that engages and inspires Detroit area youth to achieve at the rigorous level necessary to ultimately graduate with a college degree and thrive in life. Jalen is the founder of JRLA and serves as the President of the Board of Directors. A philanthropist who truly gives from the heart, Jalen has personally donated nearly $2 million via his charitable fund and to support his charter school in his hometown. In a movement to transform public education, he is also an Ambassador for the American Federation for Children.The Detroit News has recognized Jalen with the prestigious Michiganian of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence, courage and philanthropy to uplift not only the metropolitan area but all of Michigan. In 2016, he was awarded the 11th Annual National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award for his significant contributions to civil and human rights, and for laying the foundation for future leaders through his career in sports in the spirit of Dr. King. In addition, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame awarded Jalen with the 2016 Mannie Jackson - Basketball's Human Spirit Award. This prestigious honor is only awarded to those with this highest level of dedication to making a positive impact off the court.In 2007, Jalen created Three Tier Entertainment (TTE), a LA based production and management company. TTE is committed to creating an artistic haven for actors, writers and directors. TTE produces smart, provocative commercial projects with a worldwide mass appeal for film, Television and the web. In 2011, TTE executive produced ESPN's highest rated documentary "The Fab Five."Jalen released his first book in October 2015. One of the most outspoken and original voices in sports sounds off while revealing his incredible life story in Got to Give the People What They Want. This colorful collection of stories and opinions about basketball and life gives people the kind of insight and understanding they don't get anywhere else in the sports world. GTGTPWTW is a New York Times Bestseller and made the list of Michigan Notable Books from 2016. In 2016 and 2017, Jalen appeared on To Tell The Truth as a panelist. Hosted by Anthony Anderson, To Tell The Truth is an anarchic and funny re-imagination of the beloved, game show of the same name. He's also appeared on Celebrity Family Feud (2016) and Celebrity Wheel of Fortune (2003).In 2017, Jalen starred in a single-cam pilot episode from writer-creator Nahnatchka Khan (Fresh Off the Boat) that aired on ESPN. Jalen vs. Everybody also starred Anna Maria Horsford, Marla Gibbs, Kelly Jenrette, Laysla de Oliveira, Jessica McKenna and Rich Sommer.

Turan states that while he enjoys being compared to current Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi, he thinks that Messi is the "greatest player in the world". Turan had been dating Turkish actress Sinem Kobal since August 2009. The pair became engaged in January 2010, however they split in late 2013. Turan who was in a long-term relationship with Aslihan Dogan married her on 11 March 2018. Turan is also known for his humanitarian work, especially in the helping of sick children. On 11 May 2014, Turan was announced as a goodwill ambassador for the Khojaly massacre. His ambassador activities are aimed to raise awareness about this issue and promoting world peace.Turan is mostly known for his ball control, dribbling skills and vision. At age 21, prior to the 2009-10 season, he was named captain of Galatasaray. Following a successful UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, Turan was ranked eighth in a selection of the 100 Best Young Football Players in the World piece published by Spanish magazine Don Balón in July 2008. Turan was ranked 38th in "The 100 Best Footballers in the World" by The Guardian in 2014, the only player on the list to be born in Turkey. On 25 November 2014, Turan was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for 2014, among 40 other players. As of September 2017, Turan holds 99 senior national caps and 17 goals for the Turkey national team, making him Turkey's fourth-most capped player of all-time.Turan is a product of the Galatasaray youth. He was promoted to the Galatasaray first-team by manager Gheorghe Hagi in 2004-05 season, and he made his official debut against Bursaspor in a Turkish Cup match on 22 January 2005. He then had a spell on loan to fellow Süper Lig side Manisaspor in the second half of the 2005-06 season. In the 2005-06 season, Turan scored two goals for the team based in Manisa.Turan was recalled to Galatasaray for the start of the 2006-07 season and quickly broke into the first team. It was during this time that he received his first senior international call up. He helped Galatasaray qualify for the following season's UEFA Champions League group stage. Turan continued his development in the 2007-08 season, scoring seven goals in the second half of the season.At the start of the 2009-10 season, Turan was handed the captaincy of Galatasaray and given squad number 10, which had previously belonged to Metin Oktay and Hagi; Turan previously wore number 66.As captain at the start of season, Turan guided his team to six consecutive league wins games which put Galatasaray comfortably at the top of the table. In the 2010-11 season, he was troubled with injuries and played a limited number of games. By the end of the season, he had played in only 12 league matches, scoring two goals; and in three Turkish Cup matches, where he scored one. His impressive performances over the last four years of his Galatasaray career lead to interest from Spanish club Atlético Madrid.In the late hours of 9 August 2011, it was announced Turan would be joining Atletico Madrid for a EUR12 million transfer fee plus bonuses, making him the most expensive Turkish footballer of all-time. He was handed the number 11 shirt and made his 2011-12 La Liga debut on 28 August 2011 against Osasuna, entering as a substitute in the second half. He made his UEFA Europa League debut on 15 September against Celtic, starting the match and assisting a goal. On 18 September, he was again selected for the starting XI and provided two assists.On 6 July 2015, Barcelona announced the signing of Turan from Atletico for EUR34 million, plus EUR7 million in variables. The contract will run for five seasons, but Turan would only be able to debut for the Catalans in January 2016, after Barcelona's transfer ban had been lifted. On 29 December 2015, Turan picked number 7 for his shirt. Stating the match in the starting line-up, Turan made his debut on 6 January 2016 in a Derbi barceloní encounter against Espanyol in the first leg of the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey, which ended 4-1 for Barcelona. He placed a shot in the second half that was saved by Espanyol goalkeeper Pau. Turan played his first Liga match with Barcelona on 9 January 2016, the 17th matchday of the season, at home against Granada. The match ended 4-0, with Turan assisting Lionel Messi's opening goal. On 17 August 2016, Turan scored twice and Lionel Messi once as Barcelona earned a 3-0 second-leg victory over Sevilla to win the 2016 Supercopa de Espana 5-0 on aggregate.On 7 December 2016, Turan scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona during a Champions League group stage match against Borussia Mönchengladbach. He became the sixth player in Barça history to score a hat-trick in the Champions League, after Messi, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Samuel Eto'o and Neymar. This also marked Turan's first hat-trick in European competitions."

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558923	"June Mathis was born June Beulah Hughes in 1887 in Leadville, Colorado. Her father died at a young age and her mother married William Mathis. She grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, which she would proudly consider her hometown for the rest of her life.At the age of 13 she pursued a career in vaudeville, doing imitations and dances. She had success in San Francisco and eventually played The Orpheum. Her stage career grew over the next few years, bringing her good reviews and much acclaim. In 1908 she played with Julian Eltinge in "Brewster's Millions" and in 1912 joined him in "The Fascinating Widow", which was a major success.After a brief one-time foray in front of the camera in 1910 (or possibly 1911), Mathis decided she would like to be behind the camera. After two years of self-prescribed study she submitted a script in a screenwriting contest. Even though she didn't win, Mathis received several offers. She took one from Edwin Carewe, and her first produced script was for the film The House of Tears (1915).Mathis signed with Metro Pictures, where she quickly rose in the ranks. By 1918 she was writing for the studio's biggest stars, such as Francis X. Bushman, Viola Dana, Mae Murray and Alla Nazimova. Mathis became head of the scenario department, making her the first female film executive ever.In 1920 she began work on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921), a film that was hers from casting to crew to writing to production. For a director she chose Rex Ingram, and for the role of Julio she chose a small-time actor named Rudolph Valentino. The film was a major success and launched Ingram, Mathis and Valentino into superstardom. It was the top-grossing film of 1921 (beating out Charles Chaplin's The Kid (1921)), made $9 million during its original run and was the sixth highest-grossing silent of all time.Mathis and Valentino were good friends until a disagreement in 1924 over The Hooded Falcon (1924), but they reconciled before his death in 1926. Mathis moved with Valentino to Famous Players-Lasky, where she wrote Blood and Sand (1922), The Young Rajah (1922) and The Spanish Dancer (1923) (originally intended for Valentino). "Blood and Sand" was a huge success, becoming one of the top 4 grossing movies of 1922 and a defining film for Valentino, his co-star Nita Naldi and Mathis.After Valentino embarked on his one-man strike, Mathis signed with Goldwlyn Pictures as an editorial director. She was in charge of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) in the same way she had been for "The Four Horsemen". However, director Charles Brabin did not see it that way and the production was a disaster, eventually Brabin was fired and replaced by Fred Niblo and all the film that had been shot, including all of the expensive location work done in Italy, had to be scrapped and the production begun from scratch. After a year at Goldwyn Mathis left for First National. There she was again an executive, this time writing comedies (something she enjoyed doing) for Colleen Moore and Corinne Griffith.After her rift with Valentino she married Silvano Balboni, who she met while filming "Ben-Hur". After First National Mathis was rumored to be writing for UA or MGM once again, but neither came to be; she died unexpectedly in 1927 at the age of 40 from a heart ailment (from which she had suffered all her life) while watching a performance on Broadway.She was buried next to Valentino, who had died the year before, severely in debt. Mathis had loaned him the crypt but by the 1930s the arrangement became permanent. Balboni sued Mathis' 84-year-old grandmother for her estate over a technicality, causing her to lose the inheritance Mathis had intended for her. He returned to Italy in the 1930s, and her grandmother died in 1933.Mathis was not only responsible for Valentino's superstardom but for his love of art in film, and his beliefs in spirituality as well. Today she is mostly forgotten but when she died she was the third most powerful woman in Hollywood (outranking the 3 other major women screenwriters: Anita Loos, Frances Marion and Jeanie Macpherson). She was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."

Before experiencing success as a stand-up comic, she worked as a cocktail waitress.One of the first notable appearances for Butler was on Dolly Parton's ill-fated 1987 variety series, Dolly.

During the show, she battled a recurring drug addiction and spent time in rehab.Butler published her memoirs, titled Knee Deep in Paradise, in 1996. The book was started before attaining her celebrity status, and candidly addresses much of this time frame, ending the autobiography before Grace Under Fire's television debut.In February 1998, due to her erratic behavior stemming from substance abuse, she was dismissed from the show and ABC canceled the series.After Grace was cancelled in 1998, Butler moved out of Los Angeles and onto a farm in Georgia where she lived with 15 pets.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027183	"London-born Michael Anderson began his career in films as an office boy at Elstree studios. By 1938, he had progressed up the ladder to become assistant director for distinguished film makers Noël Coward, David Lean and Anthony Asquith. Shortly after, during wartime with the Royal Signals Corps (Army Kinematograph Service), Anderson made the acquaintance of Peter Ustinov. For Ustinov's third venture, Private Angelo (1949), Anderson both co-directed and co-wrote the screenplay, but the picture that first put him on the map was to be the patriotic wartime drama The Dam Busters (1955), based on true events. Britain's most successful film of 1955, in turn, led to Anderson being hired to direct the all-star blockbuster Around the World in 80 Days (1956). A hugely popular box-office hit and winner of five Academy Awards, it elevated Anderson into the realm of more ambitious international productions.His strong visual style -- in no small way complemented by a fruitful and long-standing collaboration with the cinematographer Erwin Hillier -- became ideally suited for suspenseful thrillers and action subjects like Chase a Crooked Shadow (1958), the sub-Hitchcockian psychological whodunnit The Naked Edge (1961) or the underrated maritime drama The Wreck of the Mary Deare (1959) (based on a novel by Hammond Innes and originally intended for Alfred Hitchcock who went on to do North by Northwest (1959) instead). Another little gem is the intricately plotted spy thriller The Quiller Memorandum (1966), tautly directed and noteworthy for supremely well captured Berlin exteriors (a familiarity which stemmed from Anderson having spent some of his early childhood in Berlin and Hillier having worked at Ufa in the 20s before collaborating on Fritz Lang's classic thriller M (1931)). According to Hillier, Anderson also had a reputation for being "superb at handling actors". This is reflected in his films which have often featured big name stars like Gary Cooper, Charlton Heston, Laurence Olivier or Alec Guinness.Moving into science fiction, Anderson made style triumph over content with his (for the time) expensively made dystopian thriller Logan's Run (1976). Though not a big success with critics, the picture won at the box office and helped MGM out of its financial doldrums. Also in this genre, but with less distinction, Anderson directed Millennium (1989) and a miniseries, The Martian Chronicles (1980). A foray into the world of comic strip heroes, Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze (1975), proved to be one of his rare failures. His more recent work of note has included the Gemini Award-winning TV movie Young Catherine (1991), based on the early life of Russia's Catherine the Great. Vanessa Redgrave, who played Empress Elizabeth, was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy in the Supporting Actress category.In 1957, Anderson received the Silver Medallion for outstanding work from the Screen Director's Guild of America and was in 2012 also honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of Canada. A Canadian resident since the 1970s, Anderson passed away at his home on the Canadian Sunshine Coast in British Columbia on April 25 2018 at the age of 98."
