https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574468	"McRaney holds the distinction of being the last guest star to meet ""Matt Dillon"" in a gunfight on Gunsmoke (1955) - in the episode, Gunsmoke: Hard Labor (1975), first broadcast on February 24, 1975 (he lost). In fact, in the early portion of Gerald McRaney's career he almost always played the villain; but, since his first series, Simon & Simon (1981), hit it big, he's played mostly good guys. The character of passionate but irresponsible ""Rick Simon"" gave McRaney the opportunity to play a dramatic role with a comedic edge. A second hit series, Major Dad (1989), showcased his talent for comedy. McRaney met and fell in love with fellow southerner Delta Burke when she guest-starred on Simon & Simon (1981). He later appeared on her series, Designing Women (1986), as her ex-husband, although it is an unwritten rule that actors with current series don't do guest roles; they were married not long after."

First in La Haine (1995), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside Jean Reno, made of him ""the man to count on.""

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796518	Anne Rivers Siddons is an American novelist who writes Southern Literature, novels that are set in the Southern States of America. Her bestseller, 'Heartbreak Hotel' - Heart of Dixie (1989) - was adapted to film starring Ally Sheedy , Phoebe Cates , Virginia Madsen and Peter Berg . Interestingly, Siddons' 1978 novel, ''The House Next Door'', falls into the horror genre, an uncharacteristic step for the author. The book is similar to Shirley Jackson 's The Haunting (1963), in that it features a house that is more than just haunted; the house itself is seemingly alive; and yet, the demonic force that has possessed the structure is left unknown, thus sustaining the ambiguity which makes The House Next Door (2006) such a chilling tale. Stephen King , in his book 'Danse Macabre', refers to Siddons' work as one of the best genre novels of the 20th century. The film adaptation stars Lara Flynn Boyle . - IMDb Mini Biography By: Matt Lee-Williams
